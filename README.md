# CharacterTracker
A lightweight program for helping authors to keep track of characters, lore or world building items.

## What can it do?
You can save details about a character including:
- Name
- Age
- Species (Human, Elf etc)
- Relationships to other characters
- Detailed character information

And more!<br>
<br>
There is also a world building tab that allows you to input any text you want.<br>
This is helpful for inserting random lore or constants, such as travel time, city sizes, creatures or anything else you can think of!
